# Rules

The rules that apply to QuantumultX, when you use WeChat (which is bound to an overseas mobile number), use it and will connect directly to the server without having to go through a proxy.

WeChat.list Updated from @imatrixme, adjusted to the rules applicable to QuantumultX. Thanks.

WeChatLite.list is for my own use and has been streamlined and may not work for you. Will be maintained with use (probably).
